## Implementation of Some ML Algorithms
Here you can find the implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:
 - Dimensionality Reduction
    - PCA(Principle component analysis)
    - LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis)
 - Parametric and Non-Parametric Classification
    - Parametric classification
    - Mixture of Gaussians
    - K-Nearest Neighbor
 - Multilayered-Perceptron
 
Also, there are codes for reviewing bias/variance dilemma, cross-validation and data visualization.
